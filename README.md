# Agentcon 2025 - Voice AI Demo Agent

A live demonstration voice AI agent built for the **Agentcon conference in Hyderabad**. This project showcases real-time voice interactions using LiveKit Agents framework, designed to engage with conference attendees in an interactive and playful manner.

## üéØ Purpose

This voice AI assistant was created specifically for the Agentcon 2025 conference presentation by RZLV engineers. The agent demonstrates advanced voice AI capabilities including:

- Real-time voice-to-voice conversation
- Multi-provider AI model integration (Groq, Google Gemini)
- Advanced speech recognition and synthesis
- Live conference interaction patterns

## üé≠ Agent Personality

The AI assistant has a unique personality tailored for the conference setting:

- **Curious and Tech-Savvy**: Genuinely interested in learning about attendees
- **Playfully Interactive**: Makes light jokes about AI/human interactions 
- **Conference-Aware**: References the live presentation and venue
- **Conversational**: Keeps responses under 20 words for natural flow
- **Professional yet Fun**: Balances technical demonstration with engagement

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Framework**: LiveKit Agents
- **LLM**: Groq (Llama 3.1 8B Instant)
- **STT**: Deepgram Nova-3 (Multi-language)
- **TTS**: Deepgram Aura Asteria
- **VAD**: Silero Voice Activity Detection
- **Noise Cancellation**: BVC (Background Voice Cancellation)

### Alternative Configurations

## üé™ Conference Demo Features

### Interactive Behaviors
- **Greeting**: Playful welcome acknowledging the live demo context
- **Audience Engagement**: Asks about attendees' roles (developers, business, curious)
- **Reverse Turing Test**: Light jokes about who's testing whom
- **Conference Context**: References the voice AI session and presentation

### Technical Demonstrations
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response times
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles various accents and languages
- **Noise Handling**: Works in noisy conference environments
- **Natural Conversation**: Turn-based dialogue with proper interruption handling

## üéõ Configuration Options

### LLM Providers
Switch between different language models by modifying the `session` configuration:

```python
# Current: Groq Llama
llm=groq.LLM(model="llama-3.1-8b-instant", temperature=0.7)

# Alternative: Google Gemini (uncomment to use)
# llm=google.beta.realtime.RealtimeModel(
#     model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
#     voice="Aoede",
#     temperature=0.8,
# )
```

### Voice & Speech Settings
- **STT Model**: Deepgram Nova-3 for accuracy
- **TTS Voice**: Aura Asteria for natural speech
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity/consistency
- **Language**: Multi-language support enabled
